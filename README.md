Source code for the Android app "Warlock -- Device Disabler", available on the Google Play Store. 

Warlock allows a user to disable their own device for a set period of time. It does so by continuously forcing the "LockActivity" activity to the top of the stack, preventing the user from interacting with other apps. An "emergency call" feature is included, such that users can still make phone calls in case of emergency.

To try it out, download from the Google Play Store onto your Android device. Alternatvely, download this package and open it in Android Studio, where you can test it on a Studio emulator.
